  sectionTitle: Correlation of defence and damage reduction Ratio
  description: Hey!
  content: 'In battle screen, you can find defence icon and percentage!

    

    That
    means how much damage you can resist from enemy''s attack! It could be increased
    by investing into defence.

    background color also changes how much damage
    you can resist.

    

    But, however, the formula about defence and damage
    reduction is quite complex:

    1) Your defence requirement is propotional
    to (Monster level) ^ 1.29. Some monsters might have additional modifier.

    2)
    If you have defence exponential 1% reduce item ability, 1.29 becomes 1.29 * 0.99.

    3)
    If you have tag resistance, defence requirement is multiplied by 0.93, multiplicative.

    4)
    You will take damage, which is divided by log2.5[(defence + 1000) / defence requirement
    * 5.5] * 10.

    4-1) dividing ratio couldn''t be lower than 1, higher than
    10(when you have speicial item, extened to 20)


    In short: You need at least
    1/5.5x defence of monster level^1.29 to reduce damage. You will reduce 90% of
    damage when you have 2.5/5.5x defence.'
