The sand-to-dirt, clifftop, and underwater autotiles use a corner-to-corner system.
This system allows you to make smaller terrain shapes and transition to different textures at the corners without needing custom tiles for the purpose.
It's more flexible than the traditional 15-tile system found in my other tilesets, and doesn't require any inside corner tiles as a result.
If your game engine or mapping tool requires inside corners, you can use the provided "prefabs & samples" sheet to accomodate your terrain brushes.
Likewise if your engine can't re-use or mirror tiles to make a shoreline/underwater terrain brush: USE THE PREFABS!
